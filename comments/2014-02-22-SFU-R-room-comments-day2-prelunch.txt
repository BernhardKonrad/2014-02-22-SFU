BOOTCAMP: 2014-02-22-SFU R room
DAY: 2
COMMENTS: PRE-LUNCH

File and folder organization (BK)
Markdown, knitr and RPubs (SC)
Git from shell and remote on github (BK)

Good:
-----

File structure made sense and was not what I had been doing at all

Markdown was very interesting

Markdowns were so cool

It would be nice to see git GUIs in addition to RStudio, but command line git control was the best

The assignment where we push and pulled with another was great, very useful.

Explaining Github was great, I was confused about that before the class

I can push and pull now.

Great terminal git tutorial.

Great intro to shell

The slow page in the git session was really good

Github cheat sheet is great!

Great 1on1 and step-by-step instructions

Good speed / balance between tasks

The post-it note feedback system is great!



To improve:
-----------

A bit more info in generating informative markdown documentation would be nice

A bit more of an explanation of why we use the programs/services (knitr). It only became clear later in the demo.

A bit slower with the git shell commands/interface, please

I would prefer a bit more Terminal rather than RStudio based

I would do some of the workflow process stuff with post-it notes -- get people moving around and thinking about the process: push, commit, stage, etc

Relate the git/version control stuff to real-world applications

Since I was unable to attend day 1 I felt a little out-of-the-loop because I didn't have the link to the website and scripts, etc.
