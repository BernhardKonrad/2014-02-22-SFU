Good content and pace

Good pace

Good stuff

I totally got what we covered in the morning

good attention to questions from people in the course

Your tips and tricks/common issues are really valuable!



To improve:
-----------

Please show scripts longer

Scott a little fast, hope to have an example ahead of time

It was difficult to know how to follow Scott's session. Knowing that the notes would all be available would be helpful

For Scott's presentation more hands-on step by step, follow along example rather than reading

Would like to learn about libraries and writing packages

More examples of code that we can follow along with

Can we have notes before the workshop?

A little fast. I would like to see the code docs at beginning of class, saves me having to take notes

very general intro

open/see notes before/during session. Show where Rmd file is so we can follow along and add own notes to that

As part of initial survey, could ask if we have any specific issues and if more than one student has the same you could address that
