ggplot2 (SC)
Functions and debugging (BK)
Putting it all together - the R workflow of a pro (SC)

Good:
-----

ggplot was great, good intro

ggplot summary was great! Learned some new stuff like face_wrap

Writing functions and ggplot were both awesome and useful

I like being able to copy the script from Github and running them without trying to type along with the instructor

Great to have code to follow along

The workflow demo was really informative

Really nice to see big picture in the workflow example

Seeing the R workflow was helpful, as well as reinforcing the directory structure

Very good. I really like it!



To improve:
-----------

I would like to have a ggplot cheat sheet!

I found the explanation on creating functions a little confusing

Functions were too trivial. Try to show one more complicated functions

More examples please (although they do take up a lot of time)

Ran short on time at the end, but the final section is important to bring concepts together

Would appreciate a few more (short 5 minute) breaks

Slow for more experienced R programmes (not really a bad thing though)
