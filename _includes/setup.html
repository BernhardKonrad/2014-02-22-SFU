<h3>Overview</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text
      editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
      like automatic color-coding of key words.
      The default text editor on Mac OS X and Linux is usually set to Vim,
      which is not famous for being intuitive.
      if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it,
      try typing the escape key,
      followed by ':q!' (colon, lower-case 'q', exclamation mark)
      to return to the shell.
    </p>
    <h4>The Bash Shell</h4>
    <p>
      Bash is a commonly-used shell. Using a shell gives you
      more power to do more tasks more quickly with your
      computer.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      Git is a state-of-the-art version control system. It
      lets you track who made changes to what when and has
      options for easily updating a shared or public version of
      your code on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      Python is becoming very popular in scientific computing,
      and it's a great language for teaching general programming concepts due to its easy-to-read syntax.
      We teach with Python version 2.7,
      since it is still the most widely used.
      Installing all the scientific packages for Python individually can be a bit difficult,
      so we recommend an all-in-one installer.
    </p>
    <h4>R</h4>
    <p>
      R is a programming language that specializes in statistical
      computing. It is a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis. To
      interact with R, we will
      use <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, an interactive
      development environment (IDE).
    </p>
    <h4>SQL</h4>
    <p>
      SQL is a specialized programming language used with databases.
      We use a simple database manager called [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/),
      either directly or through a browser plugin.

      popular free code editor for Windows.
      Be aware that you must add its installation directory to your system path
      in order to launch it from the command line
      (or have other tools like Git launch it for you).
      Please ask your instructor to help you do this.
    </p>

<h3>Mac OS X</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Bash</h4>
    <p>
      The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash,
      so no need to install anything.  You access bash from
      the Terminal (found
      in <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want
      to keep Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
    </p>
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      We recommend
      <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a> or
      <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
      In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>,
      which should be pre-installed.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p><em>
	Installing Git may require you to first install XCode.
	This is a very large download (several gigabytes),
	so please do it <strong>before</strong> arriving at the bootcamp.
    </em></p>
    <h5>For Mac OS X 10.7 and higher:</h5>
    <p>
      Go to the
      <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode website</a>.
      Get XCode from the App Store making
      certain to install the command line tools (from the
      Download preferences pane). Git is included in the
      command line tools.
    </p>
    <h5>For Mac OS X 10.6</h5>
    <p>
      If you have Mac OS X 10.6,
      first get XCode by going to
      <a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/">the Apple developer site</a>.
      You have to sign in with an Apple ID linked to a Developer account.
      If you don't have one,
      you can register and create one.
      Once you log in,
      go to page 8 and find "XCode 3.2.6 and iOS SDK 4.3 for Snow Leopard".
      Click to open that section,
      and then download the <code>.dmg</code> file.
      Finally,
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?can=3">install just git</a>.
    </p>

	screen press the down arrow to move down through the
	text. Type <code>yes</code> and press enter to approve
	the license. Press enter to approve the default
	location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and

    <h4>Virtual Machine</h4>
    <p>
      Some instructors prefer to have learners use a virtual machine (VM)
      rather than install software on their own computers.
      If your instructors have chosen to do this,
      please follow the instructions they have given you
      to install and configure the VM.
