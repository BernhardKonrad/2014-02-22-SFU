# RPubs

Find it at [http://rpubs.com/](http://rpubs.com/). RPubs is a website created by the creators of RStudio.  It is a site that is integrated with your RStudio software on your machine to easily share R markdown documents to the site. The site allows simple scripts, as well as renders markdown to html, and presents slides as presentations in the browser (see [here](http://rpubs.com/recology_/rresources) for example). 

3 easy steps:

* In RStudio, create a new R Markdown document by choosing File | New File | R Markdown.
* Click the `Knit` button in the doc toolbar to preview your document.
* In the preview window, click the Publish button.

If you don't have an account you can create one, or if you have one log in. 

## Presentations

RStudio has a built in presentations tool. Go to File | New File | R Presentation. Give a name for the file, and RStudio will open up a new file, and a _Presentation_ panel that updates when you save changes to the `.Rpres` presentation file.

You can easily share these presentations to RPubs, just like other R markdown files.
