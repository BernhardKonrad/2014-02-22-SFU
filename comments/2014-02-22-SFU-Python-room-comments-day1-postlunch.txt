BOOTCAMP: 2014-02-22-SFU  Python room
DAY: 1
COMMENTS: POST-LUNCH

I liked writing commands on the black board. It helps to be able to see what instructor just did (or use up arrow).

ipython was kind of slow/hard to follow.

Do the functionalities of Matlab in Python. Plotting. Good flow.  Covered all the basics. Great time.

Went a little to fast when coding for Git portion. 

Great day and well taught -- thanks! For the next week I'd be really keen to see how python can be used for plotting and interacting with other programs (e.g., R, databases, etc.).

Excellent intro on pull request/fork and clone.

Having the codes on etherpad was very helpful.

Noting bad really. Next week I'd love to see and learn on grep and testing.

So interesting! :)

Explain what the computer is doing more.

Git!

Maybe provide a couple of pages on basics before people attend. Then in session can spend the time learning the commands, syntax, etc.

Version control = very useful.
