We will write R code together "live" in the sessions, but below I link to written content on most topics, for your future reference.

Session 1.1

  * Basics of R/RStudio
  * Workspace and working directory
  * RStudio projects
  * Working via scripts (vs. direct typing/pasting in Console)
  * Sourcing and compiling an HTML "notebook" from a script
  * See
    - [R basics, workspace and working directory, RStudio projects](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/block01_basicsWorkspaceWorkingDirProject.html) -- [source](https://github.com/jennybc/STAT545A/blob/master/block01_basicsWorkspaceWorkingDirProject.rmd)
  
Session 1.2

  * Care and feeding of R objects
  * See
    - [Basic care and feeding of data in R](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/block02_careFeedingData.html) -- [source](https://github.com/jennybc/STAT545A/blob/master/block02_careFeedingData.rmd)

Session 1.3

  * Hybrid session with meta-content (version control with Git) and R content (data aggregation). May run into beginning of next session.
  * Local usage of Git; RStudio as a Git client; Git commands in the shell.
  * Data aggregation. See
    - [Data aggregation](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/block04_dataAggregation.html) -- [source](https://github.com/jennybc/STAT545A/blob/master/block04_dataAggregation.rmd)

Session 1.4

  * Making figures using `ggplot2`.
  * See
    - [Overview of the R graphics landscape](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/block90_baseLatticeGgplot2.html)
    - [Taking control of qualitative colors in `ggplot2`](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/block17_colorsGgplot2Qualitative.html)
    - [Head-to-head comparisons of `ggplot2` and `lattice`](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/block18_gapminderGgplot2VsLattice.html)
    - [Data Visualization with R & `ggplot2`](http://inundata.org/2013/04/10/a-quick-introduction-to-ggplot2/) by Karthik Ram (first few slides make a good introduction)
  
Session 2.1

  * The shell, especially file management.
  * R native equivalents for same operations.

Session 2.2

  * Version control with remote/hosted repositories. Github.

Session 2.3

  * Automation and pipelines.
  * Writing pipeline-ready scripts, i.e. file I/O and writing figures to file.
  * Scripts that run other scripts -- R, Make.
  * See
    - [Getting data out of R](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/block05_getNumbersOut.html) -- [source](https://github.com/jennybc/STAT545A/blob/master/block05_getNumbersOut.rmd)

Session 2.4

*We assume that between schedule slippage and dedicating time to RCR session, it is wise to leave one session unplanned! If we are on/ahead of schedule, we will have open Q and A and/or pose specific challenges to work on together.
    
Jenny notes to self (may not make sense to others!)

  * think about production of PDFs vs PNGs w/r/t teachable moments about git(ignore) and git(hub)
  * work with Bernhard to make sure I've left good "to do's" behind for session 2.1
  * set up repo to commit to when I'm working live; set up associated github repo; get a short URL and put here
