# This is a simple R markdown file

We can include some narrative here, that can be easily formatted as __bold__, _italics_. We can also include [links](http://software-carpentry.org) to web pags and also citations [@Fisher2013] to be processed by tools like Pandoc. And you can do inline code in text by using backticks, like `5 + 5`.

```{r}
data(iris)
head(iris)
```

This will load Fisher's iris dataset and display the first `r nrow(head(iris))` rows.
