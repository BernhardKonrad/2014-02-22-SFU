Session 1.1
  - Basics of R/RStudio
  - Workspace and working directory
  - RStudio projects
  - Working via scripts (vs. direct typing/pasting in Console)
  - Sourcing and compiling an HTML "notebook" from a script
  - Best starting point from Jenny's world: [R basics, workspace and working directory, RStudio projects](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/block01_basicsWorkspaceWorkingDirProject.html) | [source](https://github.com/jennybc/STAT545A/blob/master/block01_basicsWorkspaceWorkingDirProject.rmd)
  - Jenny will be making Git commits periodically, to set-up session 1.3.

Session 1.2
  - Care and feeding of R objects
  - Best starting point from Jenny's world: [Basic care and feeding of data in R](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/block02_careFeedingData.html) | [source](https://github.com/jennybc/STAT545A/blob/master/block02_careFeedingData.rmd) __AND__ [R objects (beyond data.frames) and indexing](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/block03_basicObjects.html) | [source](https://github.com/jennybc/STAT545A/blob/master/block03_basicObjects.rmd)
  - Jenny will be making Git commits periodically, to set-up session 1.3.
  
Session 1.3
  - Hybrid session with meta-content (Git) and R-content (data aggregation), where learners will begin using Git as we construct and refine a data aggregation script. May run into beginning of next session.
  - Version control, specifically, local usage of Git; RStudio as a Git client; simple Git commands in the shell. Bernhard to develop / select materials. Will take version control materials suggested by Jonah into account, but operating on actual files we are working with during the bootcamp.
  - Data aggregation. Best starting point from Jenny's world: [Data aggregation](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/block04_dataAggregation.html) | [source](https://github.com/jennybc/STAT545A/blob/master/block04_dataAggregation.rmd)

Session 1.4
  - Making figures using `ggplot2`. Jenny to develop / select materials. She has material but it's not out on the web yet.
  - Previous session may use some time here, but easy to adjust length of this on the fly.
  
Session 2.1
  - The shell, especially file management. Show R native equivalents for relevant operations. Bernhard to develop / select materials. Will be operating on files from day 1. And commiting the newly named/reorganized files to local repos.

Session 2.2
  - Return to version control, dealing with remote/hosted repositories. Github. Bernhard to develop / select materials. 

Session 2.3
  - Automation and pipelines. Writing pipeline-ready scripts, i.e. file I/O and writing figures to file. Pseudo Makefiles written in R. Some demo of actual Make but not full-blown coverage. Jenny to develop / select materials.
  - Relevant material from Jenny's world: [Getting data out of R](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/block05_getNumbersOut.html) | [source](https://github.com/jennybc/STAT545A/blob/master/block05_getNumbersOut.rmd) __AND__ [Writing figures to file](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/topic12_writeFigureToFile.html) | [source](https://github.com/jennybc/STAT545A/blob/master/topic12_writeFigureToFile.rmd)

Session 2.4
  - we assume that between schedule slippage, using ~30 mins for RCR, and student exhaustion, planning 3 sessions of content is plenty for day 2!
  - open Q and A is always an option as well
    
Jenny notes to self (may not make sense to others!)

  * think about production of PDFs vs PNGs w/r/t teachable moments about git(ignore) and git(hub)
  * work with Bernhard to make sure I've left good "to do's" behind for session 2.1
