Intro to git (BK)
Data aggregation using plyr (SC)

Good:
-----

PM Sections are very good! I like to see examples, and clearly the speed is very good. Help is adequate and timely.

I think it was a good pace in the afternoon

Good examples that were easy to follow

good pace, great topics covered

great explanation of git: good to know basics -> would like to know about using git with text editor

The description of git was very clear and interesting

Version control is really useful!

Great intro to Git. Would like to see how to set it up in terminal

Learning about RStudio and git was very useful

lots of helpers is good

Great 1 on 1 feedback/assistance.

Super dynamic teaching methods & multi level learning (for instructors and students)

Liked the use of Etherpad

good rate of snack/break time to teaching time

Love the beard. (must be for Scott)



To improve:
-----------

Seemed like a bit too much history of functions. Better to use more time for specific information on the use of functions.

The breaks are too long

Need coffee to refresh: Coffee instead of cookies

Not enough green onions :)

Can we have notes beforehand?

I'm completely new to R so I would have benefited form a tutorial/video beforehand

Maybe use a small part of a larger dataset - like gapminder, so I can see the kind of questions that can asked more clearly? Good in second part with iris

Found the git process difficult, maybe spend a little more time on it? (Not too much, I liked everything else we're done today, dont want to sacrifice anything)

Less syntax (can easily look up online), more pointing out what things/functions do
